    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>American goulash was one of my all-time favorite comfort food meals when I was growing up.<br>
         They served it in my school cafeteria alongside a slice of buttered white bread and a carton of milk.<br>
          This Americanized version of goulash was invented to stretch a small amount of beef into enough food for a not-so-small family. <br>
          It's a simple dish that doesn't taste simple, so it's perfect for your weeknight dinner rotation.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 large bay leaves</li>
        <li>Â½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>2 cups elbow macaroni</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <dl>
        <b><dt>step 1:</dt></b>
        <dd>Heat oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add ground beef and onion; cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly and onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Continue to cook and stir until liquid is evaporated, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, bay leaves, paprika, Italian seasoning, salt, black pepper, and cayenne.</dd>
        <b><dt>step 2:</dt></b>
        <dd>Cook, stirring occasionally, until flavors come together, about 3 minutes. Pour in broth, marinara sauce, and diced tomatoes. Pour water into the sauce jar, swirl, and pour into the pot. Stir in soy sauce; bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer until flavors intensify, about 30 minutes.</dd>
        <b><dt>step 3:</dt></b>
        <dd>Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a rapid simmer. Stir in macaroni; cook, stirring occasionally, until just barely tender, about 12 minutes. Check for doneness after 10 minutes.</dd>
        <b><dt>step 4:</dt></b>
        <dd>Remove from the heat and discard bay leaves. Stir in Cheddar and parsley. Cover and let rest for 5 minutes. Taste and season as desired.</dd>
